                          The objective of our project was to make find lanes on a road given a video
                          or an image. This project was not assigned but was used for a project in this class.
                          In this project we were using a library called OpenCV which helps with computer vision.
                          My partner were interested on how computer vision worked so this project was perfect for the situation.
                          To find the lanes we used many custom methods which are in the OpenCV library including hough lines,
                          hough transform, edge detection algorithms, gaussian blur and more. Overall the project was a fun learning
                          experience on computer vision and I would be interested in doing a similar project.

                        Ready Restaurant was my first experience with Android Studio and my group decided to make an app for
                        restaurants. Restaurants would use this app to help manage tables and wait time. This app can also be used to
                        show that they are available to other customers. Android studio was a rough experience as the software is not
                        the fastest and simplest, but we finished our goal. As of right now it is a skeleton and does not connect
                        to anything, but in the future it may be used for restaurants. The table occupation system is the best
                        part of the app as it serves a real purpose and in the future it may be able to change the default layout. Overall, the project
                        was a success and will be looking forward to adding more to the app.

                            The objective of our project was to create a game which would be
                            fun to play and also challenging to create. The game is supposed to engage
                            the player and make them enjoy playing the game. The game itself is placed
                            in space and you play as a space ranger in a space ship. Your main objective
                            is to eliminate the bugs similar to the game galaga. As you kill more bugs the
                            game gets harder. The bugs start to move faster over time but you also gain
                            upgrades as you kill more bugs. My partner and I decided we wanted to challenge
                            ourselves but we decided that 1 week was not enough to create a game this complex.
                            We remixed the game and we added the tutorial, the upgrades and difficulty increase.
                            Overall this was a very fun project to make being that it was my first ever project
                            in this field of coding. This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit">rubric</a> which we used to create the project.

                            The objective of the text adventure we created is to entertain the user and enjoy the game we created.
                            In our text adventure you act as a lost person in the woods and we ask a series of
                            questions which will determine if you make it out alive. As you answer the questions,
                            some will bring you closer to safety as some will take you to your death.
                            When you answer the questions depending on what you answer then it will take you through
                            a different series of questions. My partner and I were above schedule on the project so
                            we decided to add a couple of features, like the code not breaking when not acceptable
                            answers are typed and a couple more stages. This is one of my first ever python projects
                            and I enjoyed it a lot. This definitely helped me learn more about the language and my
                            interest for it. If you want the rubric this is the <a target="_blank" href ="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nMqH-R9JE_lgE0ZbBZy3OLaFw9e1TcXvQjJKqSixy1E/edit"> link.<a/>
