                        The objective of our project was to make find lanes on a road given a video
                        or an image. This project was not assigned but was used for a project in this class.
                        In this project we were using a library called OpenCV which helps with computer vision.
                        My partner were interested on how computer vision worked so this project was perfect for the situation.
                        To find the lanes we used many custom methods which are in the OpenCV library including hough lines,
                        hough transform, edge detection algorithms, gaussian blur and more. Overall the project was a fun learning
                        experience on computer vision and I would be interested in doing a similar project.

                      Ready Restaurant was my first experience with Android Studio and my group decided to make an app for
                      restaurants. Restaurants would use this app to help manage tables and wait time. This app can also be used to
                      show that they are available to other customers. Android studio was a rough experience as the software is not
                      the fastest and simplest, but we finished our goal. As of right now it is a skeleton and does not connect
                      to anything, but in the future it may be used for restaurants. The table occupation system is the best
                      part of the app as it serves a real purpose and in the future it may be able to change the default layout. Overall, the project
                      was a success and will be looking forward to adding more to the app.
