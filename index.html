                        <P>
                          I am currently a senior at Dublin High School and have a very deep interest in computer science. I coded this website to show others the projects which I have created over my high school years and a way to reflect on what I did in the past. I want to pursue computer science in college and am starting to take many steps to make it happen.
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            I have wanted to be a software engineer since I was 14 years old. This career spoke out to me because of the environment which it belongs in. I had a passion for computers, and software engineering is a very interesting branch of the subject. Just over the summer, I was able to have the chance to build myself a computer and it was a fun and great learning experience. My father is also in this field which helped me discover. I spend a lot of time on my computer so this would be a relevant field for me to be in. My dream is to make into a big company or make a company of my own for the better of the world.
